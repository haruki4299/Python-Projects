## pong.py

A simple two player pong game that uses python turtle graphics

### How to

`cd` to the directory containing the python script. Run `python3 pong.py`. Download necessary packages if needed.

Once the game is started a pong game will start with one player using `W` and `S` key to control the paddle and one player using the up and down arrows. The graphics interface will pop up and after 3 seconds the game will begin. The goal of the game is to not let the ball touch your side of the wall and deflect it with a paddle.

The ball will accelerate with each bounce off the paddle so that the ball will be increasingly difficult to bounce back as the game progresses. The game will restart automatically once one player loses counting the score.

To quit, exit out of the window or type command-c in the terminal.

## sudoku.py

A simple sudoku solver

### How to

`cd` to the directory containing the python script. Run `python3 sudoku.py`. Download necessary packages if needed.

Within the main() function there is already a 9x9 sudoku which should be easy to spot. You may change the numbers to make your own and have the script solve it.
